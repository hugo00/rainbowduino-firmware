== Introduction ==

Rainbowduino firmware has a set of graphic functions that are associated to the command received via I2C.
The graphic subsystem consist in two main buffer, `FRONT_BUFFER` and `BACK_BUFFER`. There are also 4 auxiliary buffer available to the user.

Every graphic function works on the `BACK_BUFFER` or on one of the auxiliary buffers, while the hardware shows the `FRONT BUFFER`.  This method is used to prevent _filckering_ on the display.

Moreover, the action of swapping the two main buffers is done at the end of every refresh cycle.
