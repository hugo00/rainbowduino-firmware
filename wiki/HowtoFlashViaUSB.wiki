= How to flash a Rainbowduino device via USB =

== Introduction ==

Rainbowduino hardware hasn't a USB port for flashing the software/firmware to the onboard ATmega processor.
One simple solution is to use a standard Arduino (or a compatible board) connected in serial to the Rainbowduino hardware.


== Before you start ==

Make sure that your Arduino has no software running. To erase any code, flash the processor with the following void code:
{{{
void setup(){
}

void loop(){
}
}}}

  * power off both devices, to avoid the risk of damaging the hardware
  * connect Arduino 5V pin to Rainbowduino Vcc
  * connect Arduino GND pin to Rainbowduino GND
  * connect Arduino RX (pin 0) to Rainbowduino RX
  * connect Arduino TX (pin 1) to Rainbowduino TX
  * connect Arduino RESET to Rainbowduino DTR


== Flash the Rainbowduino ==

After selecting the proper hardware board on the Arduino IDE (ATmega168), download the code (i.e. the Rainbowduino Firmware v3.0) on the processor.
Power off both devices, and disconnect everything.

Your Rainbowduino is now ready.
